## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:
- Email: security@prismlauncher.org
- GitHub Security Advisory: [Create a security advisory](https://github.com/Prism-Launcher/prismlauncher/security/advisories/new)

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate the disclosure with you
5. **Release**: We'll release the fix and publish a security advisory

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and a fix is available. We'll publish security advisories to inform users of any security issues.
